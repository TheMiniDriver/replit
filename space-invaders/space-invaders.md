# Space Invaders


## Games Mechanics

Space invaders has a grid of alien enemies that move across the screen from one side to the other. Once they reach the end of the screen, they move down one row and start moving in the opposite direction. In this way the aliens get closer and closer to the player. The aliens at the bottom row can shoot downwards towards the player. Shooting an alien will destroy it and score points for the player. Aliens at the bottom of the screen are worth fewer points than the aliens at the top. 

The player also has some bases that they can hide behind and use as cover. All bullets (from either the player or aliens) damage the bases, and eventually destroy them.

When the aliens reach the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life. If the player loses all their lives, the game is over. Players can also be killed by aliens shooting at them.
